# Polynomial Operations and Stack Tasks  
**Data Structures and Algorithms**  


This project is developed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course. It involves implementing solutions to two distinct problems using Java, focusing on linked lists and stacks.  

## Project Overview  

### Problem 1: Polynomial Operations  
In this part of the project, singly linked lists are used to represent and perform operations on two polynomials. The implemented features include:  
1. **Addition:** Adding two polynomials and returning the resulting polynomial.  
2. **Multiplication:** Multiplying two polynomials and calculating the resultant polynomial.  
3. **Printing:** Displaying the polynomial in a human-readable format.  
4. **Deletion:** Removing a node with a specific power from the polynomial.  

The program prompts the user to input the coefficients and powers of two polynomials and provides a menu to choose the desired operation.

### Problem 2: Stack Operations  
This part implements a stack of strings using a custom array-based stack class. The operations include:  
1. **Push:** Adding multiple strings to the stack.  
2. **Pop:** Removing the topmost element from the stack.  
3. **Print:** Displaying the contents of the stack.  
4. **Check Palindrome:** Verifying if the stack is a palindrome.  
5. **Delete Middle:** Removing the middle element from the stack if its size is odd.  

The program allows the user to interact with the stack through a menu-driven interface, adhering to the constraints of using only one temporary stack for operations.
