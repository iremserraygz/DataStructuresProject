📚 Polynomial Operations & Stack Tasks
Data Structures and Algorithms 💻

This project is developed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course. It focuses on solving two distinct problems using Java: linked list operations and stack operations.

📋 Project Overview
🧮 Problem 1: Polynomial Operations
In this part, singly linked lists are used to represent and perform operations on two polynomials. The implemented features include:

Addition: Adds two polynomials and returns the resulting polynomial. ➕
Multiplication: Multiplies two polynomials and calculates the resulting polynomial. ✖️
Printing: Displays the polynomial in a human-readable format. 🖨️
Deletion: Removes a node with a specific power from the polynomial. 🗑️
The program prompts the user to input the coefficients and powers of two polynomials and provides a menu to choose the desired operation.

🔢 Problem 2: Stack Operations
This part implements a stack of strings using a custom array-based stack class. The operations include:

Push: Adds multiple strings to the stack. ⬆️
Pop: Removes the topmost element from the stack. ⬇️
Print: Displays the contents of the stack. 📝
Check Palindrome: Verifies if the stack is a palindrome. 🔄
Delete Middle: Removes the middle element from the stack if its size is odd. ❌
The program allows the user to interact with the stack through a menu-driven interface, adhering to the constraint of using only one temporary stack for operations.
